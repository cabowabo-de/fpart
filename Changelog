2020/??/??, 1.2.1 ('Cleaning room') :
    - fpsync: mask broken pipe errors when dequeueing jobs (fixes GH issue #22)
2020/01/10, 1.2.0 ('Joking') :
    - fpsync: ability to set an unlimited number of files or an unlimited size
      per sync job (fixes GH issue #9)
    - fpart: exclude files earlier (fixes GH issue #14)
      Before that change, excluded files would not make a directory empty and
      still account for its size; excluded files are now considered absent.
      That change does not apply when a directory size is computed after
      a certain depth (option -d) has been reached (in that case, once the
      maximum depth has been reached, every single file accounts for a directory
      size).
    - fpart: allow to specify paths with options '-y', '-Y', '-x' and '-X'
      (fixes GH issue #17)
    - fpart: raise limits for different internal types: the size of a file or
      partition, the number of files inside a partition and the number of
      partitions. That will make fpart(1) ready to handle bigger filesystems.
    - fpart: accept human-friendly size formats for options -s, -p, -q and -r
    - fpsync: accept human-friendly size formats for option -s
    - fpsync: use 'command' instead of 'which' to find binaries
      (fixes GH issue #20)
2018/11/15, 1.1.0 ('Reading') :
    - fpart: options -D and -E now pack files if they are explicitly passed as
      arguments
    - fpsync: simplify and fix detection of remote URLs (fixes GH issue #2)
    - fpsync: implement simple ETA when displaying status
    - fts.h: portability fix for Solaris 10 and earlier (GH PR #4)
    - fpart: fix build on Alpine Linux (GH PR #5)
    - fpsync: add timestamps and part numbers to logs
    - fpsync: add support for cpio copy tool (option -m)
    - fpart: option -Z becomes option -zz (incremental -z)
    - fpart: add option -zzz to add all directories to file lists (as empty)
    - other: lower required autoconf version to 2.63 (GH issue #7)
    - other: update RPM .spec file for CentOS and Feroda (GH issue #7)
2017/11/10, 1.0.0 ('Dancing'):
    - fpart: update embedded fts(3) using FreeBSD 12-CURRENT's version
    - fpart: add option -E to pack directories instead of files
    - fpsync: add option -E to work with directories (enables rsync(1)'s --delete)
      That option finally enables fpsync(1) to parallelize the so-called final
      rsync(1) pass, needed to remove extra files with the --delete option!
      (of course it can also be used on a regular basis instead of the usual
      'file' mode: you will get a perfect mirror without needing any extra
      --delete pass)
    - fpart: add option -0 to end filenames with a null (\0) character when
      using option -o
    - fpsync: use fpart's new option -0 in conjunction with rsync's --from0 option
      to avoid failing on filenames with special characters
    - fpsync: improve documentation
2017/04/27, 0.9.3 ('Funny words'):
    - fpsync: add support for rsync URL as target
      Suggested and tested by Harry Mangalam. Thanks, Harry!
2015/02/19, 0.9.2 ('What's that?'):
    - fpsync: add option '-S' to use sudo(1) for filesystem crawling and synchronizations
    - fpsync: add option '-O' to override default fpart(1) options
    - add RPM .spec file (see the contribs/package/rpm directory)
2015/02/06, 0.9.1 ('Let's play together'):
    - add tools/fpsync: a tool to sync directories in parallel using fpart and
      rsync. See fpsync(1) for more details.
    - fpart: print the number of files found in verbose mode only
2013/11/13, 0.9-1:
    (this minor change only impacts tarball users, fpart code itself has not
    changed)
    - Backport the following patch to config.guess:
      http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=commitdiff;h=29900d3bff1ce445087ece5cb2cac425df1c2f74
      it adds support for ppcle and ppc64le architectures.
